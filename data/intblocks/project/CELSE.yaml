description: Multimodal transport corridor connecting China to Europe through maritime and overland transport, with Greece's Piraeus Port serving as the primary European hub. The route integrates with European transport networks, including the Orient-East Med Corridor, and features the Budapest-Belgrade railway. Containers unloaded in Piraeus are transported northward through North Macedonia and Serbia to Hungary and further into European markets. This corridor is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative and allows for efficient transportation of goods between China and Europe.
