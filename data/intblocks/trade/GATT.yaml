notes: The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was signed on October 30, 1947, by 23 original signatories and came into effect on January 1, 1948. It was established as a provisional framework to promote international trade by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers. Over nearly five decades, GATT played a pivotal role in liberalizing global trade, with its membership expanding to 128 contracting parties by the end of 1994. The GATT was succeeded by the World Trade Organization (WTO) on January 1, 1995, following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations. The original GATT text continues to exist under the WTO framework as "GATT 1994," subject to modifications from the original "GATT 1947."
