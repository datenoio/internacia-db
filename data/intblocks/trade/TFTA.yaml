notes: "The Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA) Agreement was finalized and opened for signature in 2015. The agreement officially entered into force on July 25, 2024, after reaching the required threshold of 14 ratifications among its member states. The TFTA comprises 29 member states, collectively representing 53% of the African Union's membership, more than 60% of the continent's GDP (approximately $1.88 trillion), and a combined population of 800 million. The TFTA focuses on three main pillars: market integration, infrastructure development, and industrial development. It serves as a critical step toward the broader objectives of the African Union, particularly in accelerating economic integration across the continent."
