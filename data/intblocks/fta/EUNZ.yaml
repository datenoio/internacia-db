description: Comprehensive free trade agreement between the European Union and New Zealand. Upon entry into force, 91% of New Zealand's goods exports to the EU had their duties removed, with this figure set to rise to 97% after seven years. The agreement includes enforceable commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement and core ILO standards, and protects EU geographical indications for wines, spirits, and traditional food products.
