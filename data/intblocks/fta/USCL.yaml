description: Bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Chile, signed on June 6, 2003, and implemented on January 1, 2004. Upon implementation, tariffs on 90% of U.S. exports to Chile and 95% of Chilean exports to the U.S. were eliminated. All tariffs were phased out by 2015, resulting in duty-free trade for all qualifying products.
