description: Intergovernmental organization established to support anti-corruption
  efforts in South Eastern Europe. Provides a common platform for discussions among
  governments and civil society, sharing knowledge and best practices in combating
  corruption. Focuses on regional cooperation in asset disclosure, strengthening public
  institutions' resilience against corruption, promoting a culture of integrity, and
  improving asset recovery practices.
notes: Founded in 2000. The organization's Secretariat is based in Sarajevo, Bosnia
  and Herzegovina. RAI focuses on implementing evidence-based anti-corruption reforms
  aligned with international standards, such as the UN Convention against Corruption
  and the Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption. Strategic objectives

  efforts.
