  to Global Methane Initiative in 2010. GMI is a voluntary, international public-private
  partnership that brings together national governments, private sector entities,
  development banks, NGOs and other interested stakeholders to reduce methane emissions
  and advance methane recovery and use as a clean energy source. The partnership focuses
  on three key sectors: biogas (including agriculture, municipal solid waste, and
  wastewater), coal mines, and oil and gas systems. Full membership list should be
