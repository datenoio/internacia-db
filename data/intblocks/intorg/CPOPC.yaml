description: Intergovernmental organization founded by Indonesia and Malaysia to collectively
  promote the global use of palm oil. Together, the two founding countries produce
  the majority of the world's palm oil. The CPOPC was created to harmonize sustainability
  standards, coordinate production, and develop the palm oil industry among member
  countries. The organization plays a role in promoting palm oil abroad and addressing
  challenges such as trade barriers and environmental concerns.

notes: Indonesia and Malaysia together produce 90% of the world's palm oil. The organization
  was formally founded on 21 November 2015 and reached full operation in 2017. Colombia,
  Ghana, Honduras, and Papua New Guinea have attended meetings as observers, and are
  expected to become full members. In February 2023, Malaysia, as chair, invited Thailand
  to join the organisation. The CPOPC claimed in 2022 that palm oil in both founding
  countries supported 3.6% of GDP and the employment of 19 million people, including
  3.35 million smallholders.
