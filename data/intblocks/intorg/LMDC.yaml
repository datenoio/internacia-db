notes: The Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries (LMDC) is a negotiating block
  that coordinates positions in international organizations such as the United Nations

  The group's composition may vary in different contexts. According to a 2005 statement,
  the group also included Belarus, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, and Zimbabwe
  in other contexts, but the UNFCCC membership is the most current and specific list.
