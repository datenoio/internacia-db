notes: 'SGATAR was founded in 1970 and comprises 19 member jurisdictions. The organization
  does not have a permanent headquarters; instead, annual meetings are hosted by member
  jurisdictions on a rotational basis. Fiji was welcomed as a new member during the
  54th SGATAR Annual Meeting in September 2025. Singapore is scheduled to host the
  55th Annual Meeting in September 2026. SGATAR is a member of the Network of Tax
  Organizations (NTO).'
