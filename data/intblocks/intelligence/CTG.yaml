description: Intelligence-sharing group established in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks as an offshoot of the Club de Berne. The Counter Terrorism Group (CTG) focuses on sharing intelligence related to terrorist threats, particularly those stemming from Islamic extremism. It provides threat assessments to EU policymakers and serves as a platform for expert collaboration among member services. While the CTG operates outside the formal EU institutional framework, it maintains communication with EU bodies through the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (EU INTCEN), a branch of the European External Action Service. The CTG's presidency rotates in alignment with the EU Council presidency. In 2016, the CTG established a permanent cooperation platform in The Hague, Netherlands, to facilitate real-time information exchange and joint operational efforts among member states.
