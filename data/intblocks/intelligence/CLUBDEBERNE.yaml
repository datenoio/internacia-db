description: Informal intelligence-sharing forum established in 1971, comprising the intelligence services of 26 European Union member states (excluding Austria), Norway, and Switzerland. The Club facilitates voluntary exchanges of information, experiences, and perspectives among European intelligence agencies. It operates without a permanent secretariat or formal decision-making authority, emphasizing discretion and flexibility in its operations. Austria is excluded from the Club de Berne due to its tolerance of espionage activities that do not target the country itself.
