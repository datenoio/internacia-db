description: Intelligence-sharing coalition of signals intelligence (SIGINT) agencies from 14 nations, established in 1982 to enhance intelligence sharing among its members. Initially focused on monitoring Soviet military activities, the alliance has since expanded its scope to address global security concerns including counter-terrorism. Also known as the "Fourteen Eyes" or "14 Eyes" alliance, SSEUR is chaired by the director of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and operates under the guidance of the SSEUR Executive Board (SSEB). The alliance utilizes the Signals Intelligence Data System (SIGDASYS) to facilitate the exchange of military SIGINT and other information among member agencies.
