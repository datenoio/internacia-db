description: Intelligence-sharing alliance extending the Five Eyes partnership to include Denmark, France, Netherlands, and Norway. The Nine Eyes operates through less formal, ad hoc bilateral and multilateral protocols, allowing these additional four countries to access certain intelligence shared among the Five Eyes members, though their involvement is more limited compared to the core five nations. The alliance focuses on sharing signals intelligence (SIGINT) related to mutual threats such as terrorism and proliferation.
