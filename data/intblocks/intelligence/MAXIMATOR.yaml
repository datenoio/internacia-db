description: "Clandestine European intelligence-sharing alliance established in 1976, focusing on signals intelligence (SIGINT) and cryptographic analysis. The alliance operates similarly to the Anglo-Saxon Five Eyes alliance, with primary goals to enhance cooperation in satellite-based signals intelligence and address technical interception challenges through shared methods. The existence of Maximator remained largely undisclosed until 2020, when Dutch professor Bart Jacobs published an article revealing the alliance's activities. Each member country was assigned a codename: Denmark (Concilium), Sweden (Thymian), Germany (Novalis), Netherlands (Edison), and France (Marathon)."
