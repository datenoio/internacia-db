The platform convenes annual high-level meetings and has engaged representatives from 54 African Member States. The UNOCT Programme Office in Rabat, established in partnership with Morocco, has delivered tailored counter-terrorism training to over 1,000 officials from 34 African Member States since its opening in 2020.
