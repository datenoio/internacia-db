description: Secure intelligence-sharing network established by the Organization of American States (OAS) through its Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE). The Inter-American Counter-Terrorism Network (IACT) aims to facilitate real-time operational information sharing among member states to prevent and counter terrorism in the region. The network serves as a secure platform for designated national authorities to exchange information promptly, enhancing regional cooperation in addressing potential terrorist threats. As of 2024, the IACT Network has connected 33 OAS member countries across the Americas.
