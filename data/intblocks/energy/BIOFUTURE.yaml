description: Government-led, multi-stakeholder initiative established in 2016 during COP22 in Marrakech to accelerate the development and deployment of sustainable bio-based alternatives to fossil fuels, chemicals, and materials. In 2020, the Biofuture Platform became part of the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) as the CEM Biofuture Platform Initiative. The initiative is currently chaired by Italy, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) serving as the Facilitator. The platform focuses on fostering consensus on biomass sustainability, promoting policy best practices, enabling supportive financing mechanisms, and promoting cooperation on policy, regulations, and technologies.
