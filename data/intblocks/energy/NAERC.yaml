notes: "The North American power grid consists of four major interconnections that operate synchronously within their regions but are linked asynchronously through HVDC ties: Eastern Interconnection (east of Rocky Mountains), Western Interconnection (Pacific to Rocky Mountains), Texas Interconnection (independent within Texas), and Quebec Interconnection (Quebec province). NERC oversees six regional reliability entities coordinating standards across these interconnections."
