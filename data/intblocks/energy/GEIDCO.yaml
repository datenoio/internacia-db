description: Non-governmental, non-profit international organization dedicated to promoting the sustainable development of energy worldwide. The Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization (GEIDCO) advocates for the establishment of a Global Energy Interconnection (GEI) system to meet global power demand through clean and green energy sources. GEIDCO envisions GEI as a modern energy system that is clean energy-dominant and globally interconnected, utilizing advanced technologies like Ultra-High Voltage (UHV) and smart grids. As of 2024, GEIDCO has grown to include 1,390 members from 143 countries, including energy and power enterprises, equipment manufacturing, project construction, research institutions, universities, and organizations. GEIDCO has achieved consultative status with UNEP and UNIDO, and holds observer status at UN Climate Change Conference and UN Biodiversity Conference.
