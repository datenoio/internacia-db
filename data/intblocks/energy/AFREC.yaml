description: Specialized agency of the African Union (AU) responsible for coordinating and harmonizing energy policies across the continent. The African Energy Commission (AFREC) was established in 2001 by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and officially launched in 2008. AFREC's objectives include developing energy policies, creating and updating African energy statistics, mobilizing technical and financial support for member states, and implementing capacity-building programs. As of 2024, 46 African Union member states have signed the AFREC Convention, with 35 of them having ratified and deposited it. AFREC actively engages with a broad network of experts and partners across the 55 AU member states to ensure that energy initiatives align with Africa's development goals.
