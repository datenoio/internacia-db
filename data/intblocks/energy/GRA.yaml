description: Alliance established in 2022 to unify the global renewable energy industry and accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. The Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) brings together six leading international industry associations representing wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, energy storage, and green hydrogen sectors. The alliance works to strengthen the private sector's voice in accelerating the energy transition, with a shared goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030 to at least 11,000 GW. The GRA collaborates closely with governments, industry leaders, investors, NGOs, multilateral organisations, and corporations to drive action towards this target. The alliance partners with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and hosts events such as the Global Renewables Hub at COP meetings and the Global Renewables Summit.
