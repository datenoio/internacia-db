description: Treaty-based intergovernmental organization dedicated to promoting solar
  energy adoption to combat climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
  The alliance aims to mobilize $1 trillion in solar investments by 2030, provide
  energy access to 1 billion people, and install 1,000 gigawatts of solar energy capacity.
notes: The alliance primarily focuses on countries located between the Tropic of Cancer
  and the Tropic of Capricorn (sunshine countries), but is open to all United Nations
  member states. Countries outside the tropics can join but do not have voting rights.
  Founded jointly by India and France. India serves as President and France as Co-President.
  Full membership list includes 120+ countries.
