notes: Informal coalition of four fiscally conservative European Union member states
  that emerged as a successor to the New Hanseatic League after the United Kingdom's
  departure from the EU. The group advocated for maintaining EU budget contributions
  at a maximum of 1% of the EU's gross national income and opposed mechanisms like
  Eurobonds and mutualized EU debt. Denmark withdrew on June 3, 2025 to prioritize
  European defense initiatives, leading to the group's disbandment.
description: Informal coalition of fiscally conservative EU member states focused
  on advocating for strict fiscal policies and opposing large distributive budgets
  and collective EU debt within the European Union.
