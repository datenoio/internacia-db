description: Formal military organization comprising the air forces of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. AFIC enhances interoperability among these Five Eyes nations' air forces by standardizing doctrine, operational procedures, materiel, and equipment across various air power functions. Originally established as the Air Standardization Coordinating Committee (ASCC) in 1948, it was restructured as the Air and Space Interoperability Council (ASIC) in 2005 and renamed AFIC in 2017.
