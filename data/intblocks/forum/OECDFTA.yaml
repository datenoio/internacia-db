notes: 'The OECD Forum on Tax Administration was established in 2002 and comprises
  47 tax administrations from both OECD and non-OECD economies, including all OECD
  and G20 member countries, as well as selected advanced and emerging non-OECD economies. The FTA has endorsed
  initiatives like the International Compliance Assurance Programme (ICAP), which
  facilitates cooperative multilateral engagements between multinational enterprises
  and tax administrations. The forum collaborates with regional tax organizations
  to address shared challenges efficiently.'
